<div class="text">
<p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that emerged in the 1980s, characterized by a futuristic, dystopian world where advanced technology is pervasive and often used to oppress and control individuals. The term "cyberpunk" was coined by writer Bruce Bethke in his 1980 short story of the same name. However, the genre was popularized by the works of authors such as William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and Neal Stephenson.</p>

<p>Films like "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" drew heavily on cyberpunk themes and aesthetics. As technology has continued to advance, cyberpunk has evolved to incorporate new ideas and concepts. Today, cyberpunk remains a popular subgenre of science fiction, with new works continuing to be produced in literature, film, and other media. Its influence can be seen in everything from video games like 'Cyberpunk 2077, Beneath a Steel Sky, Beyond a Steel Sky' to the fashion and aesthetics of various subcultures.</p>

<p>The music I used on my playlist consist of electro, electroclash, phonk. Electro originated in the 1980s and was heavily influenced by the emerging hip-hop and funk scenes. The genre was characterized by its use of drum machines, synthesizers, and vocoders, creating a distinctive sound that was both robotic and funky. Many of the themes in electro music were also influenced by cyberpunk literature and movies, with a focus on technology, dystopian societies, and rebellion against authority.</p>

<div class="text">
<p>In the 1990s, a new subgenre of electro emerged called "electroclash". This genre was characterized by its use of retro-futuristic sounds, with influences from new wave, punk rock, and glam rock. The music was often accompanied by provocative and political lyrics, with a focus on gender and sexual identity. Many electroclash artists also embraced a cyberpunk aesthetic, with futuristic costumes, neon lighting, and other visual elements that evoked the dystopian future of cyberpunk.

<div class="text">
<p>Both electro and electroclash have continued to influence and be influenced by the cyberpunk genre. The futuristic, high-tech sound of these genres continues to be a staple of cyberpunk-themed movies, video games, and other media. Additionally, many cyberpunk-themed events and parties feature electro and electroclash music, creating an immersive experience that transports attendees into a dystopian, high-tech world..</p>
